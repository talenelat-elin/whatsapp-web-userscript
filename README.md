- The ones for switching to next and previous chats collide with the default windows keyboard shortcuts for Switching through open windows (`Ctrl+Alt+Tab`/`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Tab`), 
  - this userscript replaces the shortcuts with `Ctrl+Shift+UpArrow` for previous chat and `Ctrl+Shift+DownArrow`
- It adds shortcuts so the user can quote-reply specific messages without having to use the mouse
  1. Press `Alt+UpArrow` when a chat window is open to set the focus to last sent chat bubble in the open chat window
  2. Use `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` keys to navigate through the chat bubbles
  3. `Alt+Enter` to select the currently highlighted one for quote-replying.
